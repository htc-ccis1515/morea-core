### Tutors
There are tutors available in the [Learning Resource Center](https://www.hennepintech.edu/current/pages/259) on both the Brooklyn Park and Eden Prairie campuses.  You can drop in anytime during their business hours, but I recommend that you call to make an appointment to ensure that there is someone available with HTML & CSS skills to help you.
